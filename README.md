INTRODUCTION
=====================

This simulation framework has been implemented in OMNET++, www.omnetpp.org, version 5.0. 
The LayBack siumation framework implements function split fronthaul network as part of 
Layered Backhaul (LayBack) implemetion mechanism. The fundamental compoments include
traffic generator, functional blocks, and SDN compute. Src.cc implements the
traffic generator, fb.cc implements the functional block, and SDN.cc implements the
SDN compute node mechanism.
